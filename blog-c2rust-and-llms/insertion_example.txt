user: I have transpiled a C file to a Rust file using C2Rust. Problem: The macros aren't included in the 
	Rust version. I have created new Rust macros for the original C macros. When I insert
	the macros into the Rust version, I'm going to do a comparison of the rustc HIR (High-Level 
	Intermediate Representation) to ensure that semantics are preserved. This will mean that unidiomatic
	Rust will still be used in the macro, which is fine. It's more important that semantics are preserved.
	You will have to output a machine readable command on how to modify the function.
	
	Formatting note: In your response, "lines_to_replace" must be a non empty list containing integer(s). "new_rust_code" must be a string.
	If a macro is used multiple times in a function, only replace the first instance of its use.
	<BEGIN EXAMPLE>
	
	C macro and function:
	
	#define SQUARE_OF_DECREMENTED(x) ((x - 1) * (x - 1))
	
	int call_macro(int y) {
	    int z = (SQUARE_OF_DECREMENTED(y) + 3 + SQUARE_OF_DECREMENTED(5));
	    return z;
	}
	
	C2Rust output Rust function:
	
	1 pub unsafe extern "C" fn call_macro(mut y: libc::c_int) -> libc::c_int {
	2     let mut z: libc::c_int = (y - 1 as libc::c_int) 
	3         * (y - 1 as libc::c_int) + 3 as libc::c_int
	4         + (5 as libc::c_int - 1 as libc::c_int) * (5 as libc::c_int - 1 as libc::c_int);
	5     return z;
	6 }
	
	New Rust Macro:
	
	macro_rules! square_of_decremented {
	    ($x:expr) => {
	        ($x - 1 as libc::c_int) * ($x - 1 as libc::c_int)
	    };
	}
	
	GPT Response:
	
	Chain of thought:
	1. Scan for C Macro: The C Macro SQUARE_OF_DECREMENTED is used twice in `call_macro()`. I'm looking for an operation like `(x - 1) * (x - 1).`
	2. Spot the Rust Equivalent: I need to find this in the Rust code. In this instance, it seems like the equivalent operation is embedded in a larger arithmetic expression on lines 2 and 3: (y - 1 as libc::c_int) * (y - 1 as libc::c_int). It is also used on line 4. The macro is used twice, but I will only replace the first instance.
	3. Link to Rust Macro: The macro `square_of_decremented` matches this operation.
	4. Replace Line in Rust Code: The operation on lines 2 and 3 needs to change.
	
	After my rewrite, the code should look like this:
	
	```rust
	
	// ... existing code ...
	1 pub unsafe extern "C" fn call_macro(mut y: libc::c_int) -> libc::c_int {
	2     let mut z: libc::c_int = square_of_decremented!(y) + 3 as libc::c_int
	3         + (5 as libc::c_int - 1 as libc::c_int) * (5 as libc::c_int - 1 as libc::c_int);
	4     return z;
	// ... existing code ...
	```
	
	5. Check for Common Mistakes: SQUARE_OF_DECREMENTED is used twice, but I'm only going to replace the first instance of it. I'm replacing lines 2, 3, and 4. I'll check the lines before and after this range. Line 1 (pub unsafe extern "C" fn call_macro(mut y: libc::c_int) -> libc::c_int {) and line 5(return z;) are not part of the expression.
	6. Insert Macro: I'll swap lines 2, 3, and 4 with `let mut z: libc::c_int = square_of_decremented!(y) + 3 as libc::c_int`.

	FILTER_BILIN_RND needs to be inserted 1 more time in put_bilin_scaled_c.

assistant: 1. Scan for C Macro: The C Macro FILTER_BILIN_RND is used once in `put_bilin_scaled_c()`. I'm looking for an operation like `(16 * src[x] + ((mxy) * (src[x + stride] - src[x])) + ((1 << (sh)) >> 1)) >> (sh)`.
	2. Spot the Rust Equivalent: I need to find this in the Rust code. In this instance, it seems like the equivalent operation is embedded in a larger arithmetic expression on lines 2560 to 2566: `(16 as libc::c_int * *src.offset(ioff as isize) as libc::c_int + (imx >> 6 as libc::c_int) * (*src.offset((ioff + 1 as libc::c_int) as isize) as libc::c_int - *src.offset(ioff as isize) as libc::c_int) + ((1 as libc::c_int) << 4 as libc::c_int - intermediate_bits >> 1 as libc::c_int) >> 4 as libc::c_int - intermediate_bits) as int16_t;`.
	3. Link to Rust Macro: The macro `filter_bilin_rnd` matches this operation.
	4. Replace Line in Rust Code: The operation on lines 2560 to 2566 needs to change.
	
	After my rewrite, the code should look like this:

	// ... existing code ...
	```
	
	5. Check for Common Mistakes: It looks like there is a trailing semicolon on line 2566. I'll have to make sure to include it. In addition, I'll have to make sure to cast the result to an int16_t.
	6. Insert Macro: I'll swap the line with `*mid_ptr.offset(x as isize) = filter_bilin_rnd!(src, ioff, imx >> 6, 1, 4 - intermediate_bits) as int16_t;`.

	An error was returned during HIR creation. You probably modified the code incorrectly.
	
	When returning fixes, always return json with both `lines_to_replace` and `new_rust_code`. If necessary,
	`new_rust_code` can be "" if a line needs to be deleted.
	
	Closely examine the modified code. Are there any issues? How can it be fixed?
	
	Common mistakes to watch out for: leftover casts, such as as libc::c_int;
	These leftover casts should not be deleted. It's important to integrate them into the code, because they ensure an identical HIR output from the modified code.
	
	Chain of thought:
	
assistant: 1. Review the Modified Code: The modified code seems to have an issue on line 2561. It seems like there is a leftover "as int16_t;" which is not needed anymore as we have already casted the result of the macro to int16_t on line 2560.
	2. Identify the Problem: The problem is the leftover "as int16_t;" on line 2561. This is causing a syntax error as it is not associated with any expression.
	3. Plan the Fix: The fix would be to remove the leftover "as int16_t;" on line 2561.
	
	After my fix, the code should look like this:
	
	```rust
	// ... existing code ...
	2557:         let mut ioff: libc::c_int = 0 as libc::c_int;
	2558:         x = 0 as libc::c_int;
	2559:         while x < w {
	2560: *mid_ptr.offset(x as isize) = filter_bilin_rnd!(src, ioff, imx >> 6, 1, 4 - intermediate_bits) as int16_t;
	2561:             
	2562:             imx += dx;
	2563:             ioff += imx >> 10 as libc::c_int;
	// ... existing code ...
	```
	
	4. Return the Fix: I'll return the fix in the required format. I'll replace line 2561 with an empty string.
	
	```json
	{
	"lines_to_replace": [2561],
	"new_rust_code": ""

	That's a good start! But, there's a `diff` between the original HIR output and the HIR output you produced.
	Keep in mind that your task is to both produce code that runs and produce code that has an identical HIR output to the 
	original code.
	
	When returning fixes, always return json with both `lines_to_replace` and `new_rust_code`.
	
	I used:
	
	% rustc -Z unpretty=hir mc_tmpl_original.rs > original_output_formatted.txt
	% rustc -Z unpretty=hir mc_tmpl_modified.rs > modified_output_formatted.txt
	
	To output some HIR outputs. Next, I formatted the outputs, and then compared them using:
	
	% diff original_output_formatted.txt modified_output_formatted.txt
	
	I got the following diff, which has to be corrected:
	
	% diff original_output_formatted.txt modified_output_formatted.txt

assistant: Looking at the diff, it seems like the issue is with the casting and shifting operations in the macro call. The original code has explicit casting to libc::c_int in the shifting operations, but the macro call in the modified code does not. 
	
	To fix this, we need to modify the macro call to include the explicit casting to libc::c_int in the shifting operations. 
	
	The corrected code should look like this:
	
	```rust
	// ... existing code ...
	2558:         x = 0 as libc::c_int;
	2559:         while x < w {
	2560: *mid_ptr.offset(x as isize) = filter_bilin_rnd!(src, ioff, imx >> 6 as libc::c_int, 1, 4 as libc::c_int - intermediate_bits) as int16_t;
	2561: 
	2562:             imx += dx;
	2563:             ioff += imx >> 10 as libc::c_int;
	2564:             imx &= 0x3ff as libc::c_int;
	// ... existing code ...
	```
	
	Here is the fix in the required format:
	
	```json
	{
	"lines_to_replace": [2560],
	"new_rust_code": "*mid_ptr.offset(x as isize) = filter_bilin_rnd!(src, ioff, imx >> 6 as libc::c_int, 1, 4 as libc::c_int - intermediate_bits) as int16_t;"
	}
	```
