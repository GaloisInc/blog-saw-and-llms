user: I have transpiled a C file to a Rust file using C2Rust. Problem: The macros aren't included in the 
	Rust version. I would like to create equivalent Rust macros to match the original C. When I insert
	the macros into the Rust version, I'm going to do a comparison of the rustc HIR (High-Level 
	Intermediate Representation) to ensure that semantics are preserved. This will mean that unidiomatic
	Rust will still be used in the macro, which is fine. It's more important that semantics are preserved.
	You will have to output a machine readable command on how to modify the function.

	C macro(s) and function:
	
	#define SQUARE_OF_DECREMENTED(x) ((x - 1) * (x - 1))

	GPT Response:
	
	Chain of thought: I need to ensure the HIR has "as libc::c_int", which means it should be included in the macro.

	GPT Response:
	
	Chain of Thought for FILTER_BILIN:
	1. Analyze the C Macro: FILTER_BILIN takes in 4 parameters and has a mathematical operation involving multiplication and subtraction. The src is dereferenced using array indexing.
	2. Identify Rust Equivalents: In Rust, array dereferencing is done using indexing, but for pointer arithmetic, the offset method can be used. I have to make sure that I'm using $src, $x, $mxy, and $stride in the macro.
	3. Consider HIR Compatibility: Make sure to include explicit type casting like as libc::c_int to match the C2Rust output and ensure HIR compatibility.
	4. Write the Rust Macro: Use macro_rules! with $expr to capture expressions. Use the offset method to perform pointer arithmetic. It looks like stride is 1 in the original C macro usage, so the $stride argument will be 1.
	5. Test with Usage: Replace the direct computation in the Rust function with the new macro to ensure it integrates correctly.
	
	Chain of Thought for FILTER_BILIN_RND:
	1. Analyze the C Macro: FILTER_BILIN_RND also takes in 5 parameters. It internally calls FILTER_BILIN and has additional operations.
	2. Identify Rust Equivalents: As before, we need to use the offset method for pointer arithmetic. Additionally, we need to ensure that operations like shifting (>>) are preserved. $src, $x, $mxy, and $stride will be passed to filter_bilin!. $sh will be used in filter_bilin_rnd!.
	3. Consider HIR Compatibility: Keep the explicit type casts and the semantics consistent with C2Rust output. Especially note the as int16_t cast at the end. The $sh argument's intermediate bits is not cast to libc::c_int in the C2Rust output. The $sh argument will have to be 4 as libc::c_int - intermediate_bits as a result.
	4. Write the Rust Macro: Use macro_rules! again, making sure to invoke the filter_bilin! macro within this macro for equivalent behavior. The arguments to filter_bilin_rnd! should be very close to the original C macro arguments: (src, x, mx, 1, 4 - intermediate_bits).
	5. Test with Usage: Replace the corresponding computation in the Rust function with the new filter_bilin_rnd! macro.

	Chain of thought:
	
	To simplify the task, I will only create a macro for FILTER_WARP_RND.
	
assistant: 1. Analyze the C Macro: FILTER_WARP_RND takes in 5 parameters: a source pointer, an index, a pointer to a filter array, a stride, and a shift. It performs a weighted sum of the source index and filter and then performs a right shift operation.
	2. Identify Rust Equivalents: In Rust, pointer dereferencing is done with the same * operator as in C. The offset method should be used for pointer arithmetic. The filter index is also dereferenced which means that the filter will need to be a pointer argument in the macro.
	3. Consider HIR Compatibility: To ensure compatibility with the C2Rust output we want to preserve the semantics and the explicit type casts to libc::c_int. We also need to ensure that the shift and bitwise operations are carried out as in the original C code.
	4. Write the Rust Macro: The macro will have a similar structure to the C macro, but with Rust syntax. We'll use the $expr token to capture the expressions for the function arguments. The $src, $x, $F, $stride, and $sh arguments will be replaced with their equivalent expressions in the Rust macro.
	5. Test with Usage: After writing the macro, replace the corresponding computation in the Rust function with the macro to ensure it integrates correctly.

system: Your responses are being used in an automated system and should strictly adhere to the example provided formatting.
user: That's a good start! But, there's a `diff` between the original HIR output and the HIR output you produced.
	Keep in mind that your task is to both produce code that runs and produce code that has an identical HIR output to the 
	original code.
	
	When returning fixes, always return both the macros and new function in separate code blocks like this:
	
	{NEW_MACRO}

	This is a complex example, so I will first create a list of steps, and then use an extensive chain of thought for every step.
	In particular, I will closely examine the diff output and write down both the C2Rust syntax and the GPT macro syntax.
assistant: Chain of thought:
	
	1. Analyze the Diff: The diff seems to indicate a difference in the pointer arithmetic expression. Particularly, the multiplication between an integer and a libc::c_int is missing in the macro expansion.
	2. Identify the Issue: The macro expansion in Rust does not preserve the explicit type casting to libc::c_int in the pointer arithmetic expression. This is what causes the difference between the HIR of the original function and the HIR of the function using the macro.
	3. Modify the Macro: The macro needs to be modified to include the explicit type casting in the pointer arithmetic expression to match the HIR of the original function.
