I need to know if the elements of the argument must be initialized when passed to the function. Respond with {TRUE} if they do. Otherwise, respond with {FALSE}

<<|FUNCTION|>>
void fill(uint32_t *arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 16; ++i) {
        arr[i] = i;
    }
}

Variable: "arr"

<<|OUTPUT|>>
Chain of thought: In the function fill, the elements of the array arr are set to be equal to their indices. If the array arr was not initialized prior to the function call, it wouldn't be an issue since the values of arr are being set (i.e., initialized) inside the function. Therefore, the elements of the array do not need to be initialized prior to calling the function.

{FALSE}


<<|FUNCTION|>> 
void increment(uint32_t arr[static 16], int arr_len)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < arr_len; ++i)
    {
        arr[i] += 1;
    }
}

Variable: "arr"

<<|OUTPUT|>>
Chain of thought: In the function increment, the elements of the array arr are incremented by 1. If the array arr was not initialized prior to the function call, it would contain random data, and incrementing an unknown value is undefined behavior in C. Therefore, the elements of the array need to be initialized prior to calling the function.

{TRUE}
