user: I have transpiled a C file to a Rust file using C2Rust. Problem: The macros aren't included in the 
	Rust version. I would like to create equivalent Rust macros to match the original C. When I insert
	the macros into the Rust version, I'm going to do a comparison of the rustc HIR (High-Level 
	Intermediate Representation) to ensure that semantics are preserved. This will mean that unidiomatic
	Rust will still be used in the macro, which is fine. It's more important that semantics are preserved.
	You will have to output a machine readable command on how to modify the function.
	
	If multiple macros are included in the task, all macros must be replicated.
	
	|BEGIN EXAMPLE|
	
	C macro(s) and function:
	
	#define SQUARE_OF_DECREMENTED(x) ((x - 1) * (x - 1))
	
	int call_macro(int y) {
	    return SQUARE_OF_DECREMENTED(y);
	}
	
	C2Rust output Rust function:
	
	pub unsafe extern "C" fn call_macro(mut y: libc::c_int) -> libc::c_int {
	    return (y - 1 as libc::c_int) * (y - 1 as libc::c_int);
	}
	
	GPT Response:
	
	Chain of thought: I need to ensure the HIR has "as libc::c_int", which means it should be included in the macro.
	My function that I wrote is complete and will run successfully.

	GPT Response:
	
	Chain of Thought for FILTER_BILIN:
	1. Analyze the C Macro: FILTER_BILIN takes in 4 parameters and has a mathematical operation involving multiplication and subtraction. The src is dereferenced using array indexing.
	2. Identify Rust Equivalents: In Rust, array dereferencing is done using indexing, but for pointer arithmetic, the offset method can be used. I have to make sure that I'm using $src, $x, $mxy, and $stride in the macro.
	3. Consider HIR Compatibility: Make sure to include explicit type casting like as libc::c_int to match the C2Rust output and ensure HIR compatibility.
	4. Write the Rust Macro: Use macro_rules! with $expr to capture expressions. Use the offset method to perform pointer arithmetic. It looks like stride is 1 in the original C macro usage, so the $stride argument will be 1.
	5. Test with Usage: Replace the direct computation in the Rust function with the new macro to ensure it integrates correctly.
	
	Chain of Thought for FILTER_BILIN_RND:
	1. Analyze the C Macro: FILTER_BILIN_RND also takes in 5 parameters. It internally calls FILTER_BILIN and has additional operations.
	2. Identify Rust Equivalents: As before, we need to use the offset method for pointer arithmetic. Additionally, we need to ensure that operations like shifting (>>) are preserved. $src, $x, $mxy, and $stride will be passed to filter_bilin!. $sh will be used in filter_bilin_rnd!.
	3. Consider HIR Compatibility: Keep the explicit type casts and the semantics consistent with C2Rust output. Especially note the as int16_t cast at the end. The $sh argument's intermediate bits is not cast to libc::c_int in the C2Rust output. The $sh argument will have to be 4 as libc::c_int - intermediate_bits as a result.
	4. Write the Rust Macro: Use macro_rules! again, making sure to invoke the filter_bilin! macro within this macro for equivalent behavior. The arguments to filter_bilin_rnd! should be very close to the original C macro arguments: (src, x, mx, 1, 4 - intermediate_bits).
	5. Test with Usage: Replace the corresponding computation in the Rust function with the new filter_bilin_rnd! macro.

	This is a complex example, so I will first create a list of steps, and then use an extensive chain of thought for every step.
	In particular, I will closely examine the diff output and write down both the C2Rust syntax and the GPT macro syntax.
assistant: Chain of thought:
	
	1. Analyze the C Macro: FILTER_8TAP takes in 4 parameters and has a mathematical operation involving multiplication and addition. The src is dereferenced using array indexing.
	2. Identify Rust Equivalents: In Rust, array dereferencing is done using indexing, but for pointer arithmetic, the offset method can be used. I have to make sure that I'm using $src, $x, $F, and $stride in the macro.
	3. Consider HIR Compatibility: The diff output shows that the multiplication operation in the offset method is causing a difference in the HIR output. In the original C2Rust output, the multiplication operation is performed first and then the result is used in the offset method. However, in the macro, the multiplication operation is performed inside the offset method. To match the HIR output, I need to perform the multiplication operation first and then use the result in the offset method.
	4. Write the Rust Macro: Use macro_rules! with $expr to capture expressions. Use the offset method to perform pointer arithmetic. It looks like stride is 128 in the original C macro usage, so the $stride argument will be 128.
	5. Test with Usage: Replace the direct computation in the Rust function with the new macro to ensure it integrates correctly.

	    ($src:expr, $x:expr, $F:expr, $stride:expr) => {

system: Your responses are being used in an automated system and should strictly adhere to the example provided formatting.
user: That's a good start! But, there's a `diff` between the original HIR output and the HIR output you produced.
	Keep in mind that your task is to both produce code that runs and produce code that has an identical HIR output to the 
	original code.
	
	When returning fixes, always return both the macros and new function in separate code blocks like this:
	
	{NEW_MACRO}
	```rust
	```
	
	{NEW_FUNCTION}
	```rust
	```
	
	This applies even if the modified function is identical to your earlier response.
	This is to simplify my job of inserting the code into the right spot.
	
	I used:
	
	% rustc -Z unpretty=hir mc_tmpl_original.rs > original_output_formatted.txt
	% rustc -Z unpretty=hir mc_tmpl_modified.rs > modified_output_formatted.txt
	
	To output some HIR outputs. Next, I formatted the outputs, and then compared them using:
	
	% diff original_output_formatted.txt modified_output_formatted.txt
	
	I got the following diff, which has to be corrected:
	
	% diff original_output_formatted.txt modified_output_formatted.txt
